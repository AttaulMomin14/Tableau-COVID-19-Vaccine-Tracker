**Detailed Description**
In this Tableau project, I developed a comprehensive Covid-19 vaccine tracker to visualize and analyze vaccination data across different countries. The dashboard was designed to provide both detailed and high-level insights into global vaccination progress using various Tableau features.

**Features and Visualizations:**

**Calculated Measures and Parameters:**
- I used calculated measures to derive key metrics such as the percentage of people fully and partially vaccinated. Parameters were incorporated to allow users to adjust the views and interact with the data dynamically, enhancing the user experience and customization.

**KPI Visuals:**
- High-level KPI visuals were created to display critical vaccination statistics, including the total number of people partially and fully vaccinated, as well as the corresponding percentages. These KPIs provided an at-a-glance overview of the vaccination status globally or for selected countries.

**Country Breakdown:**
- The data was broken down by country, showing what percentage of the population was fully vaccinated and what percentage was partially vaccinated. This breakdown enabled users to compare vaccination progress across different regions and identify patterns or disparities.

**Scatter Plot:**
- A scatter plot was included to show the number of people vaccinated per hundred by GDP per capita for different countries. This visualization helped identify any correlations between a country's economic status and its vaccination rates, providing valuable context to the data.

**Dashboard Actions:**
- Interactive dashboard actions were implemented to allow users to filter and highlight data dynamically. For instance, clicking on a country in one visual would update related charts and KPIs, making the dashboard highly interactive and user-friendly.
  
**Interactivity and Customization:**
- Users could interact with the dashboard using parameters and filters to view data for specific countries or regions, adjust the timeframe, and toggle between different metrics. This flexibility made it easy to explore the data from various perspectives and gain deeper insights.

**Data Visualization and Insights:**
- The calculated measures and visualizations provided a clear and comprehensive view of global vaccination efforts. Users could quickly see which countries were leading in vaccination rates and how economic factors like GDP per capita might influence these rates.
- The combination of high-level KPIs and detailed scatter plots allowed for both macro and micro-level analysis, making the dashboard a powerful tool for understanding and communicating the state of Covid-19 vaccinations worldwide.

This project demonstrated the effective use of Tableau for tracking and analyzing critical public health data. By leveraging calculated measures, parameters, and interactive dashboard actions, the Covid-19 vaccine tracker provided valuable insights and facilitated data-driven decision-making in a visually compelling format.
